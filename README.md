A World Away: Hunting Exoplanets with AI (Classification Model)

This challenge aims to address the problem of large astronomical data volumes using Artificial Intelligence. We leveraged data from the K2 exoplanet catalog to train a classification model that can automatically distinguish between confirmed and false positive planets based on their physical properties (such as radius, orbital period, and stellar temperature).

METHODOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
1. - Data Processing & ML: Python
2. - Visualization: Visual Studio Code
