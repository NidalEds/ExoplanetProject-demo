A World Away: Hunting Exoplanets with AI (Classification Model)

Exoplanet identification is becoming an increasingly popular field of astronomical exploration. Several survey missions have been launched with the primary goal of identifying exoplanets. By utilizing the "transit method" for exoplanet detection, scientists can detect dips in light when a celestial body passes between a star and the survey satellite. Kepler is one of the most well-known transit method satellites, providing data for nearly a decade. Kepler was followed by its successor mission, K2, which used the same hardware and transit method, but maintained a different survey path. During both missions, much of the work of identifying exoplanets was done manually by astrophysicists at NASA and the research institutions that sponsored the missions. Following Kepler's retirement, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which has a similar mission to survey exoplanets, was launched and has been collecting data since 2018.
This challenge aims to address the problem of large astronomical data volumes using Artificial Intelligence. We leveraged data from the K2 exoplanet catalog to train a classification model that can automatically distinguish between confirmed and false positive planets based on their physical properties (such as radius, orbital period, and stellar temperature).
